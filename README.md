## Introduction
The IBM Data Science Professional Certificate is a comprehensive program that covers various aspects of data science, including data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and more. This repository serves as a collection of resources and projects completed during the course.

## Course Structure
The certificate program consists of the following courses:
1. What is Data Science?
2. Tools for Data Science
3. Data Science Methodology
4. Python for Data Science and AI
5. Databases and SQL for Data Science
6. Data Analysis with Python
7. Data Visualization with Python
8. Machine Learning with Python
9. Applied Data Science Capstone


### Machine Learning with Python
The "Machine Learning with Python" course covers the following topics:
- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Regression Algorithms
- Classification Algorithms
- Clustering Algorithms
- Recommender Systems
- Model Evaluation and Refinement

The `Machine Learning with Python` folder contains Jupyter notebooks and other resources related to these topics.

Labs of other courses are available in the [`IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Certificate`](https://github.com/krzysztofpk14/IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Certificate) repository.


## Capstone Project
The Capstone Project is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. It involves applying the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program to a real-world data science project. The "Data Science Project" folder contains several Jupyter notebooks that document the various stages of the project. Below is a detailed description of each notebook:

### Notebooks in the "Data Science Project" Folder

1. **Webscraping.ipynb**
   - This notebook demonstrates web scraping techniques to collect additional data from websites. It includes code to extract data from HTML pages and store it in a structured format for analysis.

2. **Spacex_Data_Collection_Api.ipynb**
   - This notebook covers data collection from the SpaceX API. It includes code to make GET requests to the API, parse the JSON responses, and clean the data for further analysis.

3. **Spacex_Data_Wrangling.ipynb**
   - This notebook focuses on data wrangling techniques. It includes steps to clean, transform, and prepare the SpaceX dataset for analysis and modeling.

4. **EDA_Data_Visualization.ipynb**
   - This notebook focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques. It includes the use of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize the dataset.

5. **EDA_SQL.ipynb**
   - This notebook demonstrates how to perform EDA using SQL. It includes SQL queries to extract and analyze data from a database, as well as visualizations to present the findings.

6. **Launch_Site_Location.ipynb**
   - This notebook analyzes the geographical locations of SpaceX launch sites. It uses the Folium library to create interactive maps and visualize the launch sites and their proximities.

7. **SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction.ipynb**
   - This notebook involves building a machine learning pipeline to predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

These notebooks collectively document the entire process of the Capstone Project, from data collection and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and machine learning model development.
